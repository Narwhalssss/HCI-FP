                    <p>Sometimes in our daily life we forgot our time to do the most important things in life. 
                        This made us lose valuable time and productivity. People tend to forget what they should be doing the most important thing
                        and that is Work. People also tend to do bad habits such as playing games or watching movies. By this people can be easily distracted
                        and do not progress at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>That's why by using uCal we offer to organize your calendar for you.
                        By using uCal, we provide assistance so that our users can focus on what they do while we organize their plans using our Smart Calendar system. We use the system so that the user events are fit with their daily lives.</p>
